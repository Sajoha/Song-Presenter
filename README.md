## Usage

This is being developed with the iOS platform in mind, to run it use `ti build -p ios`.

Currently the song files will be stored in the `./Resources/assets/songs` directory. At the moment these are `.txt` format, however converting this to `.json` would be preferable to allow more details to be outlined and used.
